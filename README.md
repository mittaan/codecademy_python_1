# Codecademy: Python Portfolio Project n.1

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to build and document the development of a simple interactive terminal game using Python.

## Game Explanation

The game is straightforward, you are presented with a set of white squares to choose from. Only one will make you progress to the next level of the path, while the others will lower your try-count.

Based on the difficulty chosen, the path will vary in size, as well as the try-count â€” decreasing as the difficulty increases.

## Repo Explanation

All of the code is kept in the <code>./src</code> folder:
- <code>libs.py</code> file: implements two classes, _Board_ and _Path_, the core components of the program
- <code>main.py</code> file: contains the full logic of the program, specified in the <code>start_game(difficulty)</code> function
